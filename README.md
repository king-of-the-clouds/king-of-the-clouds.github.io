# king-of-the-clouds.github.io
Jackson Currin, email adressed used was feckbatman4@gmail.com
I used the address feckbatman4@gmail.com and the username king-of-the-clouds
The repository I created was used my username and followed the template in the instructions. 
The layout of the desktop app I'm using seems very different than what the instructions are describing, so I tried my best, and I was able to click on the repository and click "clone." I didn't know I had to install another application to edit the README file but hopefully this works.
